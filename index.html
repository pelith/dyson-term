    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This website and related services (collectively, the "Service") provide a
      platform for accessing and interacting with the Dyson Finance Protocol and
      DYSN ERC20 Token (collectively, the "Protocol"). By using the Service, you
      agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and all applicable laws and
      regulations.

    <h2>Assumption of Risk</h2>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies carry
      inherent risks, including, but not limited to, volatility of
      cryptocurrency prices, technical failures, hacking and theft, changes to
      applicable regulations, and other risks not yet known. You hereby accept
      sole responsibility for determining whether use of the Protocol is
      appropriate for you. You understand that losses can exceed any amount you
      provide or fund.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Waiver of Claims</h2>
    <p>
      In accordance with the principle of mutual assumption of risks, except for
      reasons attributable to this service, you hereby waive all claims,
      damages, losses, obligations, costs, or debts against the creators of the
      Protocol, the community, third-party providers, and any affiliated
      entities arising from or related to your use of the Protocol and Service.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Prohibited Jurisdictions</h2>
    <p>
      The Service and Protocol may be subject to local regulations. You
      represent and warrant that your use does not violate any applicable laws
      or regulations of your jurisdiction. Users may not access or use the
      Service if located in, under the control of, or ordinarily resident in any
      Prohibited Jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Service and Protocol are provided on an "as is" and "as available"
      basis without warranties of any kind. Use of the Service is at your own
      risk. No advice or information obtained from the Service constitutes
      investment advice or a recommendation to use the Protocol.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      In no event shall the Protocol creators, community, third-party providers,
      or any affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or
      consequential loss or damages of any kind.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms may be modified at any time by posting the revised Terms on
      the Service website. Modifications shall be effective immediately. You are
      responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications.
      Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms
      means that you accept and agree to the modifications.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Severability</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the
      objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
      applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force
      and effect.
